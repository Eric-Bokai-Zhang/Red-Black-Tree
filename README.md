# Red-Black-Tree

This is Red-Black-Tree storing tuples of key and value.
The key need to be comparable (extends Comparable<K>), and the value can be any type.

Main structure of the tree is in the folder Red-Black-Tree/src/core.
The test code is in the folder Red-Black-Tree/src/test.

./src/test/Key.java and ./src/test/Value.java can be modified with need.


TODO:
1. fix the breaking of structure when deleting the black node with red sibling and the sibling has no child.
